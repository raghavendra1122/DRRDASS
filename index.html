In conclusion, I am a mixture of Parop, Trongsap, Kurtoep and Sharchop heritage. I was born in Wangdue Phodrang and spent the first three years of my life in Sha. I spent my primary years and also got my primary education in Changzamtog School, Thimphu. I later spent the formative years of my life in paro since class 6. Since a young age I have always been passionate about reading. Growing up in Thimphu, I was not exposed to my culture very much. That is why I deeply value our Bhutanese culture and history. History happens to be my favorite subject at school. I am also good at cultural activities. I am good at dancing but, singing is mostly out of self interest. I can also act out any role given to me. Acting has helped me express my fellings.I can also weave thanks to my grandmother's help who is from lhuntse(a place known for its skilled weavers).</p>

				<h2>Our Collective Goal : Reducing Waste In Our Communities</h2>
				<div>
					
					<p>
						<h4>Dechen's Action Plan</h4> 
					 <p>When I return to school after the summer vacation, I take on the responsibility of leading the students in a weekly cleanup of the school surroundings. Before sharing my ideas with the students, I decide to first communicate them to my mentor, Mr. Kapoor, through email. If my proposal is accepted, I will then proceed to share my ideas with the rest of the students.</p>

					 <p>To ensure regular cleaning, we schedule our cleanup sessions to take place after every mentor-mentee meeting on Saturdays. Each session will last for about 20 minutes, during which we will diligently clean the designated areas. To ensure proper waste management, we will keep the collected waste in a designated area where the administration team can easily access it for disposal.</p>
					
					 <p>Additionally, I plan to deliver a presentation to the entire school about the importance of waste management. During the presentation, I will explain why it is crucial for us to manage our waste and how it impacts our environment. I will also discuss potential solutions to address this issue and present our plans for improvement.</p>
					
					 <p>One of our primary goals is to increase the number of dustbins placed throughout the school campus. Currently, there is a shortage of dustbins, so it is vital that we address this issue. To tackle this challenge, we will employ resourcefulness and utilize waste materials, such as plastic bottles or bags, to create our own dustbins.</p>
					
					 <p>We aim to provide three additional dustbins in our mentor-mentee group, specifically designated for plastic bottles, non-degradable waste, and biodegradable waste. These dustbins will be strategically placed near the amphitheater, close to the Prajna Hall, and in proximity to the parking area. To construct these dustbins, we will collect plastic bottles and make use of wood as a material.
					
					 By implementing these measures, we hope to create a cleaner and more environmentally friendly school environment, while also promoting the importance of waste management among the students and staff.</p>

					<h4>Raghavendra's Action Plan</h4>

                   <p>In my school, we have a group known as "Prefects" who are chosen from Grade 5 till 10 grade and led by an appointed captain. They are responsible for keeping our school and environment clean. To ensure proper waste management, we have implemented waste segregation bins for different types of waste and my school also has a "PET" bottle crusher.</p>

                   <p>However, to improve the cleanliness of our school, I intend to found a dedicated Environment Club that will help the school management make better decisions. Through the combined efforts of Prefects, teachers, and students, we aim to make our school a shining example of effective waste management and environmental stewardship.</p>

					<h4>Rigtsel's Action Plan</h4>
				    <p>To control the excessive waste in my community, I will collaborate with my mentor and the non-academic VP. Firstly, we will raise awareness regarding waste management. I will deliver a brief awareness speech and provide my suggestions.</p>

					<p>1) Cleaning Campaign:</p>
					<p>We currently conduct a cleaning campaign every two months. In this campaign, we divide ourselves into groups and clean our community and nearby highways. To improve the campaign, we will start by collecting waste from in and around our community. We will then sort the waste into categories such as degradable waste, bottles, containers, hazardous waste, and e-waste. We will recycle the items that can be recycled, and with the bottles and containers, we can create a terrarium, which is a garden made from recycled materials. This approach will help minimize the amount of waste and make waste disposal easier.</p>
					
					<p>2) Junk Food Checking:</p>
					<p>We will continue our practice of checking for junk food in our school, which we currently do every Friday and Monday. As there are 18 captains, during the assembly, we will visit the allocated classrooms and check each student's bag for junk food. We will write down the names of those who brought junk food to school. It is important to note that we will not consume the confiscated junk food. Instead, we will dispose of it in the dustbin in front of everyone during the assembly.</p>
					
					<p>3) Reusable Eco-Friendly Bags:</p>
					<p>I will personally approach our arts and crafts teacher and request to learn how to make reusable eco-friendly bags. I will then seek support from my fellow captains and the school administration to gradually implement the use of these bags in our school. This will help reduce the reliance on single-use plastic bags and promote eco-friendly alternatives.</p>
					
					<p>By implementing these suggestions, we aim to create a cleaner and more environmentally friendly community. Each of these steps plays a significant role in waste reduction and instilling responsible waste management practices among students and community members.</p>

					<h4>
						Aksa's Action Plan
					</h4>
				 </p>
				 <p>We have a concept of having waste warriors in our school who help in keeping the school environment clean. In my school, waste warriors are nominated from grade 7 by the teacher and the principal. They are led by a teacher or a captain directly appointed by the principal. Having waste warriors not only brightens our school community but also reduces waste around the school.</p>

				 <p>We have different waste bins for waste segregation, such as pet bottles, wet waste (food remains), and dry waste. However, the waste bins are not always used properly. To ensure their proper use, I propose creating sign boards with plain wooden templates where I will paint the various types of waste segregation for each bin. Additionally, I will discuss with the principal and convince the art club to make posters raising awareness about waste management, which can be pasted around the school campus.</p>
				 
				 <p>I also propose initiating a regular cleaning campaign in school. I will share this idea with the person who leads the waste warriors and suggest having all students, regardless of their grade, participate in a cleaning campaign once every two weeks during weekends. These campaigns will be led by respective class teachers.</p>
				 
				 <p>As a waste warrior, I will assist in cleaning the school campus and keeping it free of waste. I suggest having regular checks to ensure that the school remains free of junk food, which will not only contribute to cleanliness but also reduce the production of waste.</p>
				 
                <p>
					<h4> Shayrub's Action Plan</h4>
					<p>When I return to Drukgyel, I hope to organize a club called the "Green Guardians" which would be in charge of taking care of the environment using green waste. We have an agriculture garden in our school and day scholars can bring manure from home while boarders can make compost out of green waste found in the kitchen mess.</p>
                    <p>To encourage the students, we would assess all the classes through a certain criteria and award certificates to the best ones. Drukgyelians are very competitive and they need motivation to do something good.</p>
                    <p>The club will be organized in collaboration with SAP captains, EVS students from class 10, principal mam and my mentor at school.</p>

				<p>
						<p>At the FAB Lab, we embarked on the soap making process by designing our very own soap mold using Tinkercad, an amazing 3D modeling software. We carefully crafted a digital representation of the desired shape and size, incorporating various design elements to make the mold truly unique and captivating.</p>
						
						<p>Once our soap mold design was finalized, we moved on to designing a custom soap box using Tinkercad as well. This box would serve as the perfect container to hold and protect our soap during transportation and storage. With the freedom to customize the design, we added personal touches and branding elements to make it truly our own.</p>
						
						<p>With our soap mold and soap box designs completed, it was time to prepare the soap solution. We meticulously measured and blended molten Shea Buttur, Green Tea, Lemon Zest and Lemon Juice in not so precise proportions to enhance the soap's properties and aesthetic appeal.</p>
						
						<p>Excitedly, we poured the carefully prepared soap solution into the custom-designed mold, ensuring an even distribution and eliminating any pesky air bubbles. With anticipation, we left the mold undisturbed, allowing the soap solution to solidify and dry. The drying time varied based on our specific soap recipe and the surrounding environmental conditions.</p>
						
						<p>Once our soap had thoroughly dried and hardened, we gently removed it from the mold. Now it was time to showcase our craftsmanship and attention to detail. The soap box, which we had previously designed on Tinkercad, was the perfect complement. It elegantly housed our soap, providing a professional and visually appealing packaging solution that enhanced its overall presentation and marketability.</p>
						
						<p>The soap making process at the FAB Lab was an incredible journey that highlighted the seamless integration of digital design tools with traditional soap making techniques. By leveraging Tinkercad's capabilities, we were able to create soap products that were not only functional but also reflected our personal style and creativity.</p>

				<p>Jim zo or clay sculpture is one of the oldest crafts in Bhutan that has been practiced and passed down over the centuries. The most precious and blessed clay statues made by Trulku Dzing during the reign of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel (1594-1651- The Founding Father of Bhutan) in seventeenth century are still found in many monasteries and Dzongs (Fortresses).</p>
				<p>Clay statues of Buddhist deities, gods, goddess and other prominent religious figures exemplify clay sculpture in the country.  Clay is found across the country in different pigments. The success in the clay work lies in a balanced combination with other materials like traditional desho paper or beaten bark of the Daphne plant. It also requires skills in shaping and designing the wet clay.</p>
				<p>The Sculpture Making Exercise helped us to comprehend the profound impact and significance of art in the preservation of culture and heritage. It heightened our awareness of the invaluable role that art plays in safeguarding our cultural heritage.</p>

				<center>

						<p>The Choeten comprises a total of five floors. As per the guidance of Yonphula Rinpoche, various statues, buildings, and special items were placed inside the Choeten.</p>
						
						<p>On the ground floor, there is a statue of Buddha. Moving up to the first floor, there is a statue of Lama Ugyen Norlha. On the second floor, there is a statue of Druptho Thangtong Gyalpo. The next floor houses the statue of Lama Dorji Sempa. Finally, on the top floor, there is a sacred item called "choe ku" or Yoepa May.</p>
						
						<p>After the completion of the Choeten, Yonphula Rinpoche himself visited the site to celebrate and participate in a special ceremony. This event held great significance as Rinpoche's presence added spiritual blessings and sanctity to the newly constructed Choeten.</p>
						
						<p>Additionally, before the construction of the Choeten began, Yonphula Rinpoche had also graced the location with his presence, providing guidance and support throughout the project. His involvement in both stages of the process further emphasized the importance of the Choeten and its spiritual significance for the community.</p>
						
						<p>The construction of the Choeten in Bhutan in 2008 marked a significant event in the country's history. It coincided with the crowning of the 5th King, the initiation of the Mang Tsho Rindro festival, and the commemoration of 100 years of monarchy in Bhutan. The construction aimed to address the challenges faced by the local people, particularly regarding their agricultural activities, which were hindered by natural disasters such as floods and forest fires.</p>
						
						<p>Mr. Tshampa Karchung, along with a group of local people from Yangneer gewog, took the lead in building the Choeten. Prior to commencing the construction, Mr. Karchung discussed the project with Yonphula Rinpoche, who readily agreed to support and assist in the construction process. Rinpoche's involvement added a sense of blessings and spiritual guidance to the project.</p>
						
						<p>Located in the village of Pangthang, the Choeten became a revered spiritual landmark in the community. The completion of the Choeten brought a sense of joy, pride, and stability to the Bhutanese people. It served as a place of worship and pilgrimage, allowing easier access to a sacred site compared to the original Dorji Dhen Choeten in Bodhgaya, India.</p>
						
						<p>The construction process faced various challenges, but the unity, determination, and devotion of Mr. Karchung, the local people, and the support of Yonphula Rinpoche ensured its successful completion. The Choeten, with its five floors, housed statues of Buddha, Lama Ugyen Norlha, Druptho Thangtong Gyalpo, Lama Dorji Sempa, and the sacred item "choe ku" or Yoepa May.</p>
						
						<p>Yonphula Rinpoche himself visited the Choeten after its completion to celebrate and participate in a special ceremony, adding spiritual significance to the site. His presence during both the pre-construction phase and the completion ceremony further emphasized the sanctity of the Choeten.</p>
						
						<p>The construction of the Choeten not only addressed practical challenges but also fostered a deeper sense of cultural and spiritual identity among the Bhutanese people. It stood as a testament to the faith, unity, and commitment of the community to their spiritual heritage, serving as a place of solace, blessings, and guidance for generations to come.</p>

						<center>
						<p>Rath Yatra which literally means, ‘Festival of Chariots’ is mainly associated with the Hindu and Buddhist community of India. On this day, the idols of Lord Jagannath and his siblings are decorated and brought to cover a 3-km-long journey (from Jagannath Temple to the Gundicha Temple) in chariots drawn by over hundreds of devotees, every year.</p>
					    <p>According to the Hindu calendar, Rath Yatra is observed on the second day of Ashadha month i.e., late June or early July. In ancient literature, this day is referred to as ‘Ashadha Shukla Paksha Dwitiya’. In 2023, Rath Yatra will take place on 20 June (Tuesday).</p>
					     <p>The word ‘Jagannath’ is derived from the Sanskrit language that translates to ‘Lord of the Universe’ in English; Lord Jagannath is considered as a form of Lord Vishnu.</p>

						<p>Chorten Kora is an important stupa next to the Kholongchu River in Trashi Yangtse, in East Bhutan. Nearby is a town of the same name. The stupa was built in the 15th century by Lama Ngawang Lodrö, the nephew of Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal in order to subdue a harmful demon believed to have been living at the site where the stupa is now located. The stupa is modeled after the famous Boudhanath stupa in Nepal popularly known as Jarung Khashor.</p>

                        <p>Chorten Kora took twelve years to construct and was consecrated by Je Yonten Thaye. The demon that had harmed the people of the valley was apparently subdued and banished. Thereafter, it is said that the people of the valley continue to live in peace and harmony.</p>

							Hot springs, as the name suggests, are springs with hot water. They maintain their hot temperature even in winter when snowflakes surround the water. Hot springs are typically formed by the presence of magma deep beneath the Earth's surface, which heats the surrounding rocks. When rain or groundwater comes into contact with these heated rocks, the water warms up. The heated water then flows through cracks in the ground and accumulates on the Earth's surface, creating a hot spring.
						  </p>
						  <p>
							In Bhutan, the locals refer to hot springs as "tsahachu." Mineral water is known as "drubchu," and medicinal water as "menchu." The Bhutanese people believe that tsahachu, drubchu, and menchu are blessings from the Buddha. As a result, hot springs in Bhutan are considered sacred sites and are revered for their miraculous healing properties.
						  </p>
						  <p>
							Tsahachu is similar to menchu, which involves a hot stone bath using the medicinal water mentioned above. The difference lies in the use of fresh water and wormwood leaves in the hot stone bath. Instead of being naturally heated like hot springs, the heat in a hot stone bath is generated by placing roasted river stones into the tub.
						  </p>
						  <p>
							There is a tsahachu in Gelephu, located approximately 15 km from the southern town of Gelephu in Sarpang. This particular tsahachu was officially opened in 1962 by the Gelephu Dzongkhag Administration. The tsahachu area features four well-like structures.

							  "Zhey" is a traditional folk dance of Bhutan that literally means "dance." It involves singing and dancing to fast-paced rhythmic tunes. The dancers perform rigorous movements, gradually increasing in pace as the performance unfolds.
							</p>
							<p>
							  Zhey is exclusively performed by men in Bhutan. According to legend, Tshangpa Jarey Yeshi Dorji, the founder of the Drukpa Kagyu sect, faced obstacles while trying to build a Drukpa temple due to a demon in the form of a tortoise at the construction site. In frustration, he created a song and dance called zhey. In the song, he proclaimed himself as the son of Pelden Drukpa, making him unbeatable. Through the zhey dance, he defeated the demon and successfully completed the temple.
							</p>
							<p>
							  When the great Lama Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal arrived in Bhutan from Tibet in 1616, he was welcomed by the local Bhutanese at the northern border in Gasa. They performed zhey as an expression of their devotion to him.
							</p>
							<p>
							  There are four main styles of zhey:
							</p>
							
							 <p>Goen Zhey (Gasa) </p>
							 <p> Wang Zhey (Thimphu) </p> 
							  <p>Nub Zhey (Trongsa) </p>
							  <p>Wochubi Zhey (Paro) </p>
							
							<p>
							  Each style of zhey has its own characteristics, including the number of dancers, dance steps, and dress code.
							</p>
							<p>
							  Nub Zhey is performed by the people of Jee village for their local deities. The name "Nub Zhey" is derived from the Zha ked language spoken by the village people. The dance consists of 22 steps.
							</p>
							<p>
							  The dress code for Nub Zhey includes a red gho, symbolizing devotion to Buddhism, and a blue tego, representing the medicinal herbs found in the country. The dancers also wear a khamar, which is a white kabney with a red, white, and blue stripe along its edges, symbolizing adherence to the precepts. They don traditional knee-length boots called Ko Ilham and a Dungkar-gi along, a conch shell finger ring symbolizing victory over invaders. Additionally, they wear a thoe, a ring-like headband representing the teachings of the Lama.
							</p>
							<p>
							  The Nub Zhey dance is performed during the Trongsap tshechu festival.
